-- Note: __OVERTURE_RELEASE__ is a placeholder substituted at runtime.
-- The download_divisions.sh script fetches the latest release version from the
-- Overture STAC catalog and replaces this placeholder via sed before execution.
-- Example: sed "s|__OVERTURE_RELEASE__|2025-01-01.0|g" ... | duckdb

-- Extract global divisions (cities, towns, neighborhoods, counties)

-- Country/region name lookups:
-- We join with country and region divisions to get their full names for search.
-- This allows "cambridge uk" to match Cambridge, GB-ENG because search_text
